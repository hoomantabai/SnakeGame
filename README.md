# SnakeGame

Hello,

Thais is a Snake game and shows a tiny snake start moving around and your job is to control the snake using the arrow keys on the keyboard. You should prevent the snake hitting the walls otherwise the game is over. There will be some food to eat witch they show up one by one after the snake starts eating them. The snake gets bigger by the result of eating the foods. Keep in mind that you should prevent the snake connecting herself, otherwise the game is over again.
